# Headers

In this chapter, you'll gain comprehensive knowledge **essential for securing web pages**, including fundamental insights into the **HTTP protocol** and its operation.

## Learn About HTTP Protocol

**HTTP** is an **application layer protocol** designed for transferring information between networked devices, operating on top of the network protocol stack.

/>

In a typical HTTP interaction, <Badge className="!text-sm">a client machine</Badge> sends a request to <Badge className="!text-sm">a server</Badge>, which then responds with a message.

### What is Request

An HTTP request is how Internet communication platforms, like web browsers, request the information needed to load a website. Each HTTP request sent over the Internet includes a set of encoded data that **conveys various types of information**. A typical HTTP request comprises:

- HTTP version
- A URL
- An HTTP method
- HTTP request headers
- An optional HTTP body

Let’s delve deeper into how these requests operate and how their contents facilitate information exchange.

### HTTP Method

An HTTP method, also known as an **HTTP verb**, specifies the action that an HTTP request **expects from the server**. Below is a list of HTTP methods that are widely popular and frequently used in the creation of **REST APIs**:

/>

### Request with Headers

HTTP headers **consist of text information organized into key-value pairs** and are present in every HTTP request (and response, which we'll cover later). These headers convey <Badge className="!text-sm" color="fuchsia">essential details</Badge>, such as the client’s browser type and the data being requested.

Here’s an **example** of HTTP request headers from **Google Chrome's** network tab:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
```

### What Is in an HTTP Request Body?

The body of an HTTP request holds the actual data <Badge className="!text-sm" color="orange">being transferred</Badge>. It contains information submitted to the web server, such **as a username and password** or other form data.

/>

### What Is in an HTTP Response?

An <Badge className="!text-sm" color="indigo">HTTP response</Badge> is what web clients (typically browsers) **receive from a server** in reply to an <Badge className="!text-sm" color="yellow">HTTP request</Badge>. These responses provide **crucial information** based on the request made.

A typical **HTTP response** includes:

- An HTTP status code
- HTTP response headers
- An optional HTTP body

### What’s an HTTP Status Code?

HTTP status codes are **3-digit numbers** used to indicate the outcome of an **HTTP request**. They are categorized into five classes:

<img
  className="pointer-events-none w-full select-none overflow-hidden rounded-lg"
  src="https://www.xeonbd.com/wp-content/uploads/HTTP-Response-Status-Codes.png"
/>

The **xx** represents different numbers ranging **from 00 to 99**.

Status codes starting with "2" signify a successful operation. For example, a **200 OK status code** is commonly seen after **a client requests a webpage**, indicating that the request was successfully processed.

### What Are HTTP Response Headers?

Similar to HTTP requests, **HTTP responses** include headers that provide key details, such as **the language and format of the data** included in **the response body**.

Here’s an **example** of HTTP response headers from **Google Chrome's** network tab:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 01 Jun 2021 12:00:00 GMT
Expires: -1
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Server: gws
X-XSS-Protection: 0
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Alt-Svc: h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-T051=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q050=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q046=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q043=":443"; ma=2592000,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="46,43"
```

### What Is in an HTTP Response Body?

**Successful** HTTP responses to <Badge className="!text-sm" color="fuchsia">GET</Badge> requests typically have a body containing the requested information. In most web interactions, this body includes **HTML data** that a web browser will **render into a webpage**.
