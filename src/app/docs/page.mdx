## How to Use the Documentation?

If you're new to HTTP headers and **unfamiliar with their role in security**, we recommend starting with the <Link href="/docs/headers">Headers</Link> section. This section provides a comprehensive introduction to **security-related headers**, explaining their functions and importance.

Occasionally, you may come across a badge labeled <Badge color="amber">Work in progress</Badge> in the documentation. This indicates that **the subpage is still under development** and not yet complete, meaning the provided examples or tools might not function as intended.

You can further explore the content through **practical examples and instructional videos**, which will deepen your understanding and help you apply this knowledge effectively.
