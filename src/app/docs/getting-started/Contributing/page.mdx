## What You Need to Know Before Getting Started?

Before diving into the project, here are a few things you should be aware of:

<ol>
1. **Document Creation and Editing**: You will need to know where to create and edit documents. Navigate to the **/app/docs** directory, where you'll find files with the **.mdx** extension.

2. **Markdown for Layout**: Use Markdown to design a simple layout for your documents. This content will be automatically converted to HTML for you.

</ol>

By understanding these basics, you’ll be ready to start creating and editing your documentation effectively.

### Create Your First Document

To get hands-on experience with Markdown syntax, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Directory**: Set up a new folder named `test` and add a file named `page.mdx` inside it.

2. **Run the Server**: Start the development server by executing: `npm run dev{:sh}`.

3. **View Your Document**: Open your browser and navigate to <Link href="http://localhost:3000/docs/test">http://localhost:3000/docs/test</Link> to see your document.

Below is a simple example of Markdown code that you can copy and paste into `page.mdx` to begin testing:

```js showLineNumbers
import { MyComponent } from "my-component";

Welcome to my MDX page!
This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Checkout my React component:

<MyComponent />

Feel free to experiment with different Markdown features.
```

Start experimenting and see your changes live in the browser!
